# CHSH Game
In one Jupyter Notebook we will simulate the CHSH Game and how a Quantum Strategy with Entangled qubits can always beat the 75% maximum success rate of any Classical Strategy

In another Jupyter Notebook we send the CHSH Game to a Real Quantum Computer in the cloud 

x,y are the values randomly sent by C (Charlie) to Alice and Bob and can be 0 or 1. 

a and b are the responses sent back to C by Alice and Bob. 

Game is won if (x AND y) is equal to (a XOR b).

We will Explore both the Classic and Quantum Strategy
